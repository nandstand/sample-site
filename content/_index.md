## Overview

The writing samples featured on this site represent documentation that I've authored for software teams while working in a scientific computing setting.
They emulate developer onboarding material, written for a fictional research project maintained on a public university high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

### Featured documentation

The samples include a [how-to guide](/get-started/quickstart/), a [tutorial](/get-started/hpc-tutorial/), and a [reference document](/reference/environment-variables/).

Something about motivation for writing these, how they map to the real work that I did.

### What this documentation covers

The writing samples on this site cover some topics specific to HPC environments, like working with a batch job scheduler.
The samples also cover more common development topics, like Python dependency management and version control using Git.

The Coastal Air Quality Research Network (CAQRN) generates air quality index products for public environmental health research.
The project is maintained and deployed on a public university HPC cluster (see [Stanford's Sherlock cluster](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/) as an example).

## About this site

I built this site using Hugo, a static site generator, using the Docsy theme.
The site is automatically tested and deployed to GitHub Pages via a CI/CD pipeline that includes a link checker and Markdown linter.
See the workflow files for [CI tests](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [deployment](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to see how I did it, or view the site's [full source](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site).

## Research and writing process

Before writing these samples, I drew from public resources to build reference material outlining how the software project works.
To see this reference material and my research process for designing the sample project, see the [reference](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site/tree/main/reference) included in the site's repository.
