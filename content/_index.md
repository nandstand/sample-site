This site hosts sample documentation for a fictional software project, meant to represent the kinds of documentation that I authored in a previous role as a developer in a scientific computing setting.

The samples include a how-to guide, a tutorial, and a reference document.
To write each of these, I drew from public resources to build a set of reference material outlining how the project works.
To read more about my research process, and for more information about the fictional project that these docs are written for, see the overview.
