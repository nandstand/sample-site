## About this site

This site hosts sample documentation for a fictional software project, meant to represent the kinds of documentation that I authored in a previous role as a developer in a scientific computing setting.

The samples include a [how-to guide](/get-started/quickstart/), a [tutorial](/get-started/hpc-tutorial/), and a [reference document](/reference/environment-variables/).
To write each of these, I drew from public resources to build a set of reference material outlining how the project works.
To see this reference material and my research process for designing this fictional project, see the [reference](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site/tree/main/reference) included in the site's repository.

I built the site using Hugo, a static site generator, and the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme.
The site is automatically tested and deployed to GitHub Pages via a CI/CD pipeline that includes a link checker and Markdown linter.
To see how I set this up, see the workflow files for [CI tests](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml) and [deployment](https://github.com/nandstand/sample-site/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
