# Reference

This directory contains research notes and reference scripts that I used to write the sample documentation in this repository. 

The scripts in this directory are samples, and are meant to represent the kind of scripts that I've worked with as a developer supporting scientific computing projects in a previous role. These sample scripts are based on publicly available HPC provider documentation and open source scientific computing projects (see `sources.md`).

## Contents

- `general.md` - Big-picture project architecture notes
- `deployment.md` - Notes related to how the project is deployed and how jobs are scheduled
- `sources.md` - Research resources
- `sandbox_env.sh` - Reference script, developer sandbox environment
- `staging_env.sh` - Reference script, staging environment
- `production_env.sh` - Reference script, production environment
- `processing_job.sh` - Reference script, Slurm job script
